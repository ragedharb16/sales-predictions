Seafood is one of the best proteins in the market, with more nutricions less fat, that has unlimited benefits to the health of the humans

 
 we cant notice thaty the healthy sales are more than regular food
 
 we can take advantage of that ?
 
 

are we doing enough information to sale the benefits? 

how about the many ways to cooked ?

i think if we point the right way we can triplicate the sales of the seafood after the consideration that we made
